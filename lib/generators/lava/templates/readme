We're not quite there yet! There's some things for you to do (if you don't mind!)

1) Add the following to application.js 
  //= require "lava/application"

2) Add the following to application.css
  /* = require "lava/application" */

3) Add the following to your routes: (Lava must be mounted as lava at the moment.)
  mount Lava::Engine => "/", :as => "lava"

4) rake db:migrate

5) Have fun!


Thanks!
